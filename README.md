# VueProject1

A coding tutorial created to utilize Vue for the first time. Completed through Mammoth Interactive at [link to Mammoth Interactive Homepage](https://training.mammothinteractive.com/courses).

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vue

## Dependencies
Vue, @vitejs/plugin-vue, Vite

## Uses
To learn basic functions of Vue. I also used this project to focus on the structure of my files. Trying to create consistent line breaks, use of quotation marks, etc.

## How I veered from the original project
- all of the example code is in the same file. So when npm run dev is ran all of the code is in one place to review.

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. The course did not spend a lot of time using Vue, beyond introducing it as one of a few JavaScript frameworks.
